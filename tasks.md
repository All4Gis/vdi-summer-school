## Planetary data tasks

### Overall objectives:

* Familiarise with web services for search and discovery of planetary dataÌ¦
* Familiarise with planetary data
* Visualise imagery and topography
* Perform simple Mosaicking and mapping
* Familiarise with crater size-frequency surface dating

### Task 1

- find your way through the printed maps.
- Try and draw tick marks of longitude, latitude
- look for features you can locate via web services (see [resources](resources.md), e.g. "Find an image over Mons Olympus"

### Task 2 (Friday?)

- look for HRSC data over Valles Marineris on [USGS Pilot](http://pilot.wr.usgs.gov) (see [resources](resources.md))
- download 2 adjacent red channel images
- change projection to both with gdal (see [useful-commands](useful-commands.md))
- load them onto QGis

### Task 3

- load and mosaic Mercury images using [gdal_merge](https://www.gdal.org/gdal_merge.html)
- try and repeat from another Solar System body via [POW](https://astrocloud.wr.usgs.gov/index.php?view=pow) (see [resources](resources.md))

### Task 4
- (hardcopy) try and determine surface ages via crater size-frequency dating
